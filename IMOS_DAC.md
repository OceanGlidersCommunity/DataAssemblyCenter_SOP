# IMOS DAC

Data providers willing to get their data hosted in AODN can contact us via email at info@aodn.org.au. 
The Australian Ocean Data Network provides storage for both static and ongoing datasets. 
Conversation around whether the dataset will be delivered through the AODN portal (a data collection, ongoing) or AWS S3 / THREDDS server (static dataset) will be held as a preamble of the submission process. 
 
The process described below the case of a user who wants to archive data and have a metadata record describing it. 
Further information is available from the AODN portal website https://help.aodn.org.au/contributing-data/.
Process for ongoing data collection requires further discussion in relation to the ongoing submission of data files, and data publication to the AODN portal.

## Metadata Officer
To assist metadata creation in these situations, the AODN directs users to utilise our AODN Data Submission tool - https://metadataentry.aodn.org.au/submit/. 
The tool provides a user-friendly interface to guide users in the creation of both metadata to describe their data, and where applicable, data submission in the one process. 
Help documentation is provided to users in the use of the tool, and if further assistance is required, the AODN metadata officer is the point of contact. The AODN Data Submission tool requires that users create a log in, and after a user has successfully submitted their metadata and data for upload, this process is not automated but the submission will be checked over by the metadata officer and a relevant data officer (dependent on the data type and source). 
Information to create a metadata record consist in :
- an abstract, 
- keywords, 
- details for principal investigator(s), 
- organisations details, 
- geographic extent, 
- temporal extent, 
- instruments, 
- parameters, 
- methods, 
- and if links to related documents.
Both the metadata and data will not be uploaded to the relevant metadata catalogue (IMOS or AODN), until after both have been qualitatively and quantitatively checked. 
A link will be provided from the metadata record to the location of the data.

## Data Officer
The data officer will work with the user to upload the data in the most appropriate format, NetCDF being the preferred format. 
Information on the contents of NetCDF files currently being uploaded by IMOS Ocean Gliders to AODN is found in the following document: http://content.aodn.org.au/Documents/IMOS/Facilities/Ocean_glider/Delayed_Mode_QAQC_Best_Practice_Manual_OceanGliders_LATEST.pdf
