# BODC DAC

BODC collaborates closely with UK glider operators including the NOC, SAMS, UEA and BAS. Where data are open BODC include the forwarding of data to OceanGliders and the UK Met Office for dissemination to the GTS. 
Where data management is supported, BODC works with principal investigators to develop the data management plans and gather metadata ahead or deployments. BODC needs to manage a mixture of open and closed data restrictions, once data transitions to open they can be shared with OceanGliders. 
Where access restrictions are imposed these typically pass within 6-24 months of data version generation and arise from project level exploitation requirements such as data being associated with doctoral research activity. 
BODC processes data within the broader NOC Oceanids Command and control system (C2), version 1 of the system is described in Harris et al., (2020). 
BODC are currently developing version 2 of the processing system with key enhancements including:
- Modular architecture; 
- enabling integration of quality control, 
- a sustainable code base, and rapid development of new workflows,
- the introduction of development operations and CI/CD architecture,
- A move from scheduled tasks to an event driven system to enable rapid processing and delivery of data (minutes),
- Moving to independent processing of individual deployments to reduce dependencies for robustness and scalability,

At the time of writing an early version of version 2 was under test and should enable the timely development needed to meet the evolving data requirements of OceanGliders.
